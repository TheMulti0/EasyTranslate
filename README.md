# GoogleTranslate

This is an unofficial Google Translate API written in C#. <br/>

## How does it work

The API works with the [classic Google Translate website](https://translate.google.com/),
It uses [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium). <br/>
This API can be very slow, so if you want a fast solution for translating, I recommend you to check out the [official API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/)
 ([Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)).<br/>
 
## Release

Not right now, but I'm planning to release GoogleTranslate very quickly, so stay tuned!
