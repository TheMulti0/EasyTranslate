# EasyTranslate

This is an unofficial translate/detect API written in C#. <br/>

## How to use it

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/TheMulti0/EasyTranslate/wiki/1.-Installing-the-package) of this repo!

## Requirements

For now, the API supports [.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard), so it supports all of those slik new frameworks!

## How does it work

Right now, the API works with the [classic Google Translate website](https://translate.google.com/) (but more websites support is planned), 
It uses [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json). <br/>
This API is very quick, it uses the same engine that the website itself does, and the official Google Translate API uses.

I am having some problems with releasing this package, but 1.0.0 is out soon!
